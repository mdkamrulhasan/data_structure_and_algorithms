## 📌 Course Overview

**CIS 263 – Data Structures and Algorithms** introduces students to the fundamental principles behind efficient
computing solutions. The course focuses on the **design, implementation, and analysis of algorithms and data
structures**, emphasizing both theoretical foundations and practical applications.

Students will study key data structures such as **heaps, hash tables, trees, and graphs**, along with core algorithmic
paradigms including **greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, randomized algorithms, and
approximation techniques**. The course also examines **algorithm complexity analysis** and the classification of
computational problems into **P, NP, and NP-Complete (NPC)** classes.
